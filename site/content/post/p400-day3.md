## Pioneer 400 Day 3

This eneded up being my shortest day in time and miles. In my head I had thought of maybe passing through Idaho Falls, restocking and camping on the way to Lava Hot Springs ... it sort of made sense to me, but not how it played out and probably for the better. It was a dry, windy, dusty and warm day.

### Sawing Logs vs Logging Operations

The night before I had seen the signs about a logging operation, but had not planned on the 5 AM arrival of logging equipment/trucks. Camped right up by the little stream, I had occasionally thought I heard voices due to the burbling stream right near me.  The arrival of the logging trucksa and equipment made a very different noise. I had purposely not set my alarm, but a different sort of alarm had arrived. I thought about just getting up and getting going. Instead, I got up and relieved old man bladder and laid back down. I fell back asleep fairly easily (and had generally slept well that night) and despite hearing the clanking and rev of motors in the background, got some good rest for another two hours.  Looking out my tent door around 7 AM, this was how things looked ...

### Getting Ready to Roll

I slowly got myself ready, eating my cherry pie and snacking on some other food. I also realized I had brought 5 recovery drink mixes and was fairly confident I would only be comping four nights, so I went ahead and tried one for breakfast too. It went well with the cherry pie and whatever else it was I was eating (can't honestly recall now).  I finished packing up and noticed my rear tire pressure was on the low side. I got out my pump and added some tire. In the process, I noted that I had a broken spoke (2nd or third on that bike's rear wheel). I got out some gorilla tape I had with me and taped the broken end to another spoke to avoid rattling (even though I'm pretty sure I did it on day 1 and just hadn't noticed).

I got some water from the stream before shoving off. In the process, some cattle showed up walking my way and paused. They stared in my direction and moo'd complainingly as if I was at their watering hole and interrupting their morning routine. They sat and looked around for a bit while I filled water and eventually headed off in another direction. in hindsight, I think they headed upstream from me. Good thing I was fitlering every time I filled up from a stream, creek or similar source of water.

I took this picture of the clearing where I camped and decided to head off.

### Day 3 Legs

I had always heard that day 3 was when your legs settled in and were ready to go. My legs definitely felt better at the start of the day. Good thing too, as I would need those better feeling legs despite day 3 being my shortest day.

### Dust in the Wind

It wasn't really windy where I was yet, but there was no shortage of dust though. The roads were torn up and full of moon dust sand and dirt. I could hear logging trucks and before too long I could see them too. The roads were barely wide enough for the trucks to get through. A few rolled up behind me in the early part of the ride.
