## Money And Happiness 

I came across [this post](https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1369844561883713540) a few days ago. and I quote retweeted it [here](https://twitter.com/misfir3/status/1370149631485636608). I'd like to just take a minute to expand on it some.

### My Views Have Changed Over Time

Just going to toss this out up front. In the past, I was much more of the "be independent, don't rely on others ... you can sort things out on your own" type of person. To be fair, I still am, but everyone's problems were their own to solve and I was mainly worried about solving my own. Yours were yours, I had enough to do. I still struggle with it to be honest. Kind of a naive and uneducated "Look, that black kid from \<Insert Rough/Poor Neighborhood with numerous disadvantages\> has just as much opportunity to make things work out for himself as I do." Over time, I've become more aware of the historical racial, gender-based and societal injustices and inequalities.  My path to that view has had an exclamation point put on it in the last year.

### Early 2020, 90%

This has nothing to do with the pandemic (except this story was kind of lost in that for me til now). I was feeling a bit burned out (from life in general, including work). Work though, was the one place I felt I could negotiate something different. I now see/recognize that as 'privilege'. You can use the term 'blessing' also if you like, I would/do, but not in a way that I think I deserve it and someone else doesn't. I did work hard, but there's too many other factors that landed me that privilege for me to claim it as 'mine'. Anyhoo, I had the opportunity to say I'd like to work a little less in exchange for some mental health.

In a nutshell, I was allowed to work roughly 4 hours less (US assumes 40 hour work week for full-time salaried employees) for a 10% cut in pay. All my other benefits remained the same etc.  Now, we have 'untracked PTO' where I work, so some (including my wife) were like "why not just use that?". Fact is, my conscience wouldn't allow me to do that (~ 25 days per year) and still take other time/days off.

Funny how distant and fuzzy it seems now,but as I recall, I started in February.  I would usually knock off my 10 AM to Noon on Friday and go snow boarding or something like that (sometimes on Thursdays instead) as I was trying out a weekday pass for a local ski place. And it was helpful for sure. Not only did I start to feel less stress and restored, but I felt like my 36-ish hours at work were better focused.  While I was being fair with my company, I think mostly this helped me lop off unproductive time I was going to have anyway while my company got to pay me less.  But this isn't where I 'm going with this ...

### Was I Buying Happiness?

So, let's go back to the original point I sort of made: I was able to essentially 'buy' my time and sanity back. It's almost like I was buying happiness, right? In a way, I was sort of. I was trading money for more time, which time allowed me to go enjoy an activity. So, let's break it down, for a 10% cut in pay ...

- I spent time with a friend (who has been doing the weekday pass for years and suggested it to me)
- I learned to snowboard better and I love learning new things (i.e. helps me to be happy)
- My kids got to see me make the trade-off, and hopefully noted that "money isn't everything"

I'll admit it, it does look like I bought some happiness for 10% of my pay.

### Back to 100%

The COVID-19 pandemic and its effect were looming by early late February and by then I talked to my boss about going back to 100%. A few things that I shared with him that I'll share here:

- The 2 months had the desired effect. I did need it, but the 2 months was enough.
- I learned lessons to help me be a more prodcutive employee that didn't require I receive 90% pay.
- Difficult times were coming for others (my job is/has been insulated from the pandemic) and I could use that 10% to benefit others

## That Last Bullet Point

This experiment/experience was good and helpful and I learned from it. However, I felt that if I could 'spend' that 10% on myself, then I could use (at least some of) that 10% to benefit others, especially with the effects of the pandemic starting to surface. Now, I'm not gonna say that I immediately started giving away an additional 10% of my salary since then and/or that I've been happier during the pandemic period (definitely not how things have gone down with all the isolation). However, it all gave me perspective. If I could 'spend' (or not earn) 10% for my own happiness, why not live on a little less for myself and give more? That's what I've tried to do. I have more to learn and do still, but I am even more convinced that being on the lookout for others' well-being is a better way to be happier.

### Not Ours To Judge

And while you may not be of my faith, [what Kind Benjamin had to say in the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.16-19) encapsulates much of how this feels for me.  It's not up to me to judge someone else's circumstance and the why of those circumstances (and withhold from them if I project some judgement). If I am in a position to help, I should help.  It won't be counted to me for evil. If I beleive in accountability (I do), then any dishonesty in the request is theirs and not mine, I don't have to assume the responsibility to judge. I do have to make judgements about how and where I help, because time and resources are not endless. While I appreciate his honesty, the guy with the "why lie, it's for beer!" sign won't get my money. The guy with a sign about being a veteran, being unemployed, having a family etc ... I don't need to go background check him. If I can help, I help. If I give to one requesting support and have given what I can when the next person asks (and then I can't), that's OK and I also don't need to judge myself.

### All Beggars, Right?

But let's say they did do something to put themselves in that bad predicament? Well, haven't we all done something stupid?  And most of us, I bet have even done something stupid and not felt the full consequences of it. So, even if that person did something to land themself in said predicament, I'd like to think I could still find a way to lend a hand. I'm careful in my language there as I would like to think that, but know it's not a guarantee I would. Anyhoo ...

### Buy Some Happiness, Just Help

It's that simple, if you are in a position to help ([or to earn more so you can help more](https://twitter.com/ndm/status/1370154043100729349)), then go ahead and do it. Not spending time/effort judging is rather liberating. Add helping to that and you've got a pretty powerful anti-depressant as noted in the original tweet referenced above.

So, maybe you can use money to 'buy some happiness'.  So, go do that by using your privilege or your means to bless and help the life of another.
