## Pioneer 400

I've been wanting to do longer than overnight bikepacking trips, including at least one solo trip. These least 2 years with the pandemic and schedule conflicts with friends I might do bikepacking (or even backpacking trips) with, things have just not worked out. I haven't really had a proper 'vacation' since 2019. And by 'proper', I mean taking time off of work, leaving home and doing something to recharge, something enjoyable. You might be saying that a solo 400+ mile bike ride carrying all your gear and having intermittent resupply for food (up to 100 miles gap) and 30-40 miles in some cases for water resupply ... might not sound like vacation. I Imagine it isn't for most people and despite the physical taxation something like this induces, it is a recharge for me.

Having gotten past the heartburn of the decision making, it was time to go on Monday AM. I don't like to do these trips over Sundays if I can avoid it, so I skipped the Saturday "grand depart" and drove up to Logan, UT on Monday AM to start from Joy Ride Cycles. My hope was to average 80-ish miles a day and finish by some time on Friday. I won't spoil the ending just yet, so I'm going to push pause on the travel log portion of this for the moment.

### Bike Config

#### Bike

I decided to take my 2019 Diamondback Haanjo. It's the bike that gets the most love and abuse because it's so versatile. I have 700c wheels and ride it on the road, but love to take it on gravel and off-road with the stock 27.5 wheels. I recently added 2.1 Teravail sparwoods to those wheels and that's what I took for this trip. 

#### Bags

- DIY frame bag I made in early 2020
- Salsa 14L expedition seat pack
- Rock Bros handlebar bag
- Rock Bros top tube bag
- Oveija Negra tob tube bag (borrowed)
- 2 DIY stem bags

#### Hydration

I carried a 32 oz Nalgene in one of the stem bags and 2 24 oz bottles. I also had two CNOC Vessica bottles. They collapse down and fit my Sawyer Mini filter. I could use them to filter water as well as carry extra water when needed. In the end, they were great for carrying extra water, but a little bit small for filtering to refill all of my bottles. Were I to do it again, I'd take the larger bag (Vectos) for filtering and one of the Vessicas for carrying extra water when needed.

### TL;DR Lessons Learned

If you don't want to read the whole thing, then here's the nutshell version of my take-aways from the trip. Some are more reminders than new lessons. They're worth mentioning all the same IMO.

- Routine and consistency is your friend, it might get you through a really difficult spot/day
- Don't get behind on nutrition and other important care
- Cramping doesn't mean it's over/don't be afraid to drink that can of Coke if you need it
- Don't overthink things, but some details are important
- Bring some extra Voile straps, they will very likely come in handy
- Slowing down (to enjoy the view or restrategize) is OK, don't be in **that** much of a hurry
- The Kindness of strangers is real and invaluable

#### Newly Discovered Foods

Namely ones I hadn't really tried before, but that I recall from this ride and that helped get me through. Many of these are from day 4, the really big day (climbing, headwind & remote)

- Sour Patch Kids watermelon candy ... `:facepalm:` why did I not buy 3 or 4 bags of those?
- $0.50 Wal-mart pies (little round ones) - Don't want to know what's in them, but boy did they hit the spot, and pack in some calories.
- Mini-cans of Coke. Coke wasn't new, but the mini-cans were a revelation. More on that when I cover day 4
- Twinkies - I mean, I've had twinkies before, but never while riding and they helped get me through on day 5
- Bacon Jerky (maple flavored)

#### Things I Thought I Liked

... but that didn't really work on this trip (food-wise)

- Trail mix (too much chewing required, not enough sugar)
- Jerky (at least not the standard non-bacon variety)
- Gardettos

#### Important Prep That made this a success

I think you can always find a few things that would have helped a trip like this to be successful, but mostly you take those things for the next trip.  Here are the things that helped me

1. Lots of base miles - I wanted to get another 200 mile week or two in, but I at least did one week where I rode every day, so that I had to ride-recover-ride repeatedly.
2. Bike maintenance - The month leading up, I did a bunch of service on the bike (bottom bracket, making sure tubeless tires were squared away, new winder bars and more)
3. Test Ride/s - I went out for a couple shake down rides including a fully (but mostly 'dry') 30 mile trip on mixed terrain to figure things out.
4. Lessons from previous rides/trips as noted above.
5. Great route - I cannot take credit for that at all, the organizers get all that credit. I did triple check that I had it downloaded and ready to go at least.

### Let's Get Going!

I plan to drop a few more posts (maybe group some days together or individual day posts). Some are already drafted, and I'll hopefully post them soon.
