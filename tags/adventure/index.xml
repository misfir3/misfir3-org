      <description>Pioneer 400 I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do longer than overnight bikepacking trips, including at least one solo trip. These least 2 years with the pandemic and schedule conflicts with friends I might do bikepacking (or even backpacking trips) with, things have just not worked out. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had a proper &amp;lsquo;vacation&amp;rsquo; since 2019. And by &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo;, I mean taking time off of work, leaving home and doing something to recharge, something enjoyable.</description>

      <description>Como Fabricar Tu Propria Bolsa &amp;hellip; Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish!
I came across this video on making a stem bag and tried it out for myself (3 times now). The picture is of the 3rd one, where I feel like I got a pretty good handle on it, but still made some mistakes (as you&amp;rsquo;ll see I also did on my 4th one)
Why This Stem Bag, Why This Post?</description>

      <description>Since I said I&amp;rsquo;d talk about bikepacking some, let me tell you about a recent (not completely successful trip). Before I continue on my summary version, let me tell you a better full version is here.
We had already canceled one planned trip (to the San Rafael well) in late March. We were starting to feel better about local trips (given the pandemic curve etc.), So we headed off. The picture at the top was from the day before the ride when I was doing a test run with the bike loaded (but dry water bottles).</description>
