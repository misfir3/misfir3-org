              <h2 id="pioneer-400">Pioneer 400</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do longer than overnight bikepacking trips, including at least one solo trip. These least 2 years with the pandemic and schedule conflicts with friends I might do bikepacking (or even backpacking trips) with, things have just not worked out. I haven&rsquo;t really had a proper &lsquo;vacation&rsquo; since 2019. And by &lsquo;proper&rsquo;, I mean taking time off of work, leaving home and doing something to recharge, something enjoyable. You might be saying that a solo 400+ mile bike ride carrying all your gear and having intermittent resupply for food (up to 100 miles gap) and 30-40 miles in some cases for water resupply &hellip; might not sound like vacation. I Imagine it isn&rsquo;t for most people and despite the physical taxation something like this induces, it is a recharge for me.</p>
<p>Having gotten past the heartburn of the decision making, it was time to go on Monday AM. I don&rsquo;t like to do these trips over Sundays if I can avoid it, so I skipped the Saturday &ldquo;grand depart&rdquo; and drove up to Logan, UT on Monday AM to start from Joy Ride Cycles. My hope was to average 80-ish miles a day and finish by some time on Friday. I won&rsquo;t spoil the ending just yet, so I&rsquo;m going to push pause on the travel log portion of this for the moment.</p>
<h3 id="bike-config">Bike Config</h3>
<h4 id="bike">Bike</h4>
<p>I decided to take my 2019 Diamondback Haanjo. It&rsquo;s the bike that gets the most love and abuse because it&rsquo;s so versatile (over 5000 miles in a little over 2 years). I have 700c wheels and ride it on the road, but love to take it on gravel and off-road with the stock 27.5 wheels. I recently added 2.1 Teravail sparwoods to those wheels and that&rsquo;s what I went with for this trip.</p>
<h4 id="bags">Bags</h4>
<ul>
<li>DIY frame bag I made in early 2020</li>
<li>Salsa 14L expedition seat pack</li>
<li>Rock Bros handlebar bag</li>
<li>Rock Bros top tube bag</li>
<li>Oveija Negra tob tube bag (borrowed)</li>
<li>2 DIY stem bags</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hydration">Hydration</h4>
<p>I carried a 32 oz Nalgene in one of the stem bags and 2 24 oz bottles. I mainly drank from the 24 oz bottle in the stem bag and refilled from the other bottles to that one. I also had two CNOC Vessica bottles. They collapse down and fit my Sawyer Mini filter. I could use them to filter water as well as carry extra water when needed. In the end, they were great for carrying extra water, but a little bit small for filtering to refill all of my bottles. Were I to do it again, I&rsquo;d take the larger bag (Vectos) for filtering and one of the Vessicas for carrying extra water when needed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/p400-day1/joy-ride-departure.jpg" alt="Bike all ready to go at Joy Ride"></p>
<p>Above is the bike all ready to go at Joy Ride bikes in Logan, Utah (aside from tweaking that dangling rain jacket on the front).</p>
<h3 id="tldr-lessons-learned">TL;DR Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to read the whole thing, then here&rsquo;s the nutshell version of my take-aways from the trip. Some are more reminders than new lessons. They&rsquo;re worth mentioning all the same IMO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Routine and consistency is your friend, it might get you through a really difficult spot/day</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get behind on nutrition and other important care</li>
<li>Cramping doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s over/don&rsquo;t be afraid to drink that can of Coke if you need it</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overthink things, but some details are important</li>
<li>Bring some extra Voile straps, they will very likely come in handy</li>
<li>Slowing down (to enjoy the view or restrategize) is OK, don&rsquo;t be in <strong>that</strong> much of a hurry</li>
<li>The Kindness of strangers is real and invaluable</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="newly-discovered-foods">Newly Discovered Foods</h4>
<p>Namely ones I hadn&rsquo;t really tried before, but that I recall from this ride and that helped get me through. Many of these are from day 4, the really big day (climbing, headwind &amp; remote)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sour Patch Kids watermelon candy &hellip; <code>:facepalm:</code> why did I not buy 3 or 4 bags of those?</li>
<li>$0.50 Wal-mart pies (little round ones) - Don&rsquo;t want to know what&rsquo;s in them, but boy did they hit the spot, and pack in some calories.</li>
<li>Mini-cans of Coke. Coke wasn&rsquo;t new, but the mini-cans were a revelation. More on that when I cover day 4</li>
<li>Twinkies - I mean, I&rsquo;ve had twinkies before, but never while riding and they helped get me through on day 5</li>
<li>Bacon Jerky (maple flavored)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="things-i-thought-i-liked">Things I Thought I Liked</h4>
<p>&hellip; but that didn&rsquo;t really work on this trip (food-wise)</p>
<ul>
<li>Trail mix (too much chewing required, not enough sugar)</li>
<li>Jerky (at least not the standard non-bacon variety)</li>
<li>Gardettos</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="important-prep-that-made-this-a-success">Important Prep That made this a success</h4>
<p>I think you can always find a few things that would have helped a trip like this to be successful, but mostly you take those things for the next trip.  Here are the things that helped me</p>
<ol>
<li>Lots of base miles - I wanted to get another 200 mile week or two in, but I at least did one week where I rode every day, so that I had to ride-recover-ride repeatedly.</li>
<li>Bike maintenance - The month leading up, I did a bunch of service on the bike (bottom bracket, making sure tubeless tires were squared away, new winder bars and more)</li>
<li>Test Ride/s - I went out for a couple shake down rides including a fully (but mostly &lsquo;dry&rsquo;) 30 mile trip on mixed terrain to figure things out.</li>
<li>Lessons from previous rides/trips as noted above.</li>
<li>Great route - I cannot take credit for that at all, the organizers get all that credit. I did triple check that I had it downloaded and ready to go at least.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lets-get-going">Let&rsquo;s Get Going!</h3>
<p>I plan to drop a few more posts (maybe group some days together or individual day posts). Some are already drafted, and I&rsquo;ll hopefully post them soon.</p>
<p><img src="/images/p400-day1/road-ahead-1.jpg" alt="Let&rsquo;s get going!"></p>
<h3 id="individual-day-posts">Individual Day Posts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drop links to the more detailed posts here once they are up. Almost two months out and the first is up!</p>
