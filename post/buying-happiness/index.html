              <h2 id="money-and-happiness">Money And Happiness</h2>
<p>First of all, Happy Pi day!  Now on to the business (post) at hand &hellip;</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1369844561883713540">this post</a> a few days ago. and I quote retweeted it <a href="https://twitter.com/misfir3/status/1370149631485636608">here</a>. I&rsquo;d like to just take a minute to expand on it some.</p>
<h3 id="my-views-have-changed-over-time">My Views Have Changed Over Time</h3>
<p>Just going to toss this out up front. In the past, I was much more of the &ldquo;be independent, don&rsquo;t rely on others &hellip; you can sort things out independent of the hand you were dealt&rdquo; type of person. To be fair, I still am, but if we take that to the extremen, then we never need to help each other right? Then we can treat anyone however we feel like and it&rsquo;s <strong>on them</strong> to pull themselves out of it, right? I used to kind of think that way, and to be honest, struggle with it still. While indepdence and self-reliance are necessary and good &hellip; taken too far, they can create a bitter isolated world. While I didn&rsquo;t have the most privileged and wealthy of families growing up, I also didn&rsquo;t have the appreciation for the privilege I did have. I thought &ldquo;well, I haven&rsquo;t been dealth the easiest hand &hellip; I&rsquo;ve got my own problems to sort&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve come to recognize the luck, good fortune, privileged and other aids that have put me into the good place I&rsquo;m in now. Over time, I&rsquo;ve become more aware of the historical racial, gender-based and societal injustices and inequalities throughout the world, but especially in the US.  This last year has put an exclamation point on that change of view.</p>
<h3 id="early-2020-90">Early 2020, 90%</h3>
<p>Despite the <code>2020</code>, This has nothing to do with the pandemic (except this story was kind of lost in that for me until now). About a year ago, I was feeling a bit burned out (from life in general, including work). Work though, was the one place I felt I could negotiate something different. I now see/recognize that as &lsquo;privilege&rsquo;. You can use the term &lsquo;blessing&rsquo; also if you like, I would/do. However, I do not use it in a way that I think I deserve something special and someone else doesn&rsquo;t. I did work hard, but there&rsquo;s too many other factors that landed me that privilege for me to claim it as &lsquo;mine&rsquo;. Anyhoo, I had the opportunity to say I&rsquo;d like to work a little less in exchange for some mental health benefits.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I was allowed and arranged to work roughly 4 hours less per week (US assumes 40 hour work week for full-time salaried employees) for a 10% cut in pay. All my other benefits remained the same etc.  We have &lsquo;untracked PTO&rsquo; where I work, so some (including my wife) were like &ldquo;why not just use that?&quot;. Fact is, my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to do that (~ 25 days per year) and still take other time/days off and I was aiming to force myself to take time off regularly.</p>
<p>Funny how distant and fuzzy it seems now, but as I recall, I started in February 2020.  I would usually knock off by 10 AM to Noon on Friday and go snowboarding or something like that (sometimes on Thursdays instead) as I was trying out a weekday-only season pass for a local ski place. It was helpful mentally and emotionally for sure. Not only did I start to feel less stress and restored, but I felt like my 36-ish hours at work were better focused.  While I was being fair with my company, I think mostly this helped me lop off unproductive time I was going to have anyway while my company got to pay me less.  But this isn&rsquo;t where I &lsquo;m going with this &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="was-i-buying-happiness">Was I Buying Happiness?</h3>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go back to the original point I sort of made: I was able to essentially &lsquo;buy&rsquo; my time and sanity back. It&rsquo;s almost like I was buying happiness, right? In a way, I was sort of. I was trading money for more time, which time allowed me to go enjoy myself. So, let&rsquo;s break it down, for a 10% cut in pay &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent time with a friend (who has been doing the weekday pass for years and suggested it to me)</li>
<li>I learned to snowboard better and I love learning new things (i.e. helps me to be happy)</li>
<li>My kids got to see me make the trade-off, and hopefully noted that &ldquo;money isn&rsquo;t everything&rdquo;</li>
<li>I took more time off w/o any guilt around it</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it, it does look like I bought some happiness for 10% of my pay.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-100">Back to 100%</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and its effect were looming by late February and talked to my boss about going back to 100%. A few things that I shared with him that I&rsquo;ll share here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2 months had the desired effect. I did need it, but the 2 months was enough at that point.</li>
<li>I learned lessons to help me be a more prodcutive employee that didn&rsquo;t require I receive 90% pay.</li>
<li>Difficult times were coming for others (my job is/has been insulated from the pandemic) and I could use that 10% to benefit others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="that-last-bullet-point">That Last Bullet Point</h2>
<p>This experiment/experience was good and helpful and I learned from it. However, I felt that if I could &lsquo;spend&rsquo; that 10% on myself, then I could use (at least some of) that 10% to benefit others, especially with the effects of the pandemic starting to surface. Now, I&rsquo;m not gonna say that I immediately started giving away that 10% of my salary since then and/or that I&rsquo;ve been all the happier during the pandemic period (definitely not how things have gone down with all the isolation). However, it all gave me perspective. If I could &lsquo;spend&rsquo; (or not earn) 10% for my own happiness, why not live on a little less for myself and give more to others who have material needs? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve tried to do. I have more to learn and do still, but I am even more convinced that being on the lookout for others&rsquo; well-being is a better way to be happier.</p>
<h3 id="not-judging">Not Judging</h3>
<p>While you may not be of my faith, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.16-19">what Kind Benjamin had to say in the Book of Mormon</a> encapsulates much of how this feels for me.  It&rsquo;s not up to me to judge someone else&rsquo;s circumstance and the why of those circumstances (and withhold from them if I project some judgement). If I am in a position to help, I should help.  It won&rsquo;t be counted to me for evil. If I beleive in accountability (I do), then any dishonesty in the request is theirs and not mine, I don&rsquo;t have to assume the responsibility to judge. I do have to make judgements about how and where I help, because time and resources are not endless. While I appreciate his honesty, the guy with the &ldquo;why lie, it&rsquo;s for beer!&rdquo; sign won&rsquo;t get my money. The guy with a sign about being a veteran, being unemployed, having a family etc &hellip; I don&rsquo;t need to go background check him. If I can help, I help. If I give to one requesting support and have given what I can when the next person asks (and then I can&rsquo;t), that&rsquo;s OK and I also don&rsquo;t need to judge myself.</p>
<h3 id="all-beggars-right">All Beggars, Right?</h3>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say they did do something to put themselves in that bad predicament? Well, haven&rsquo;t we all done something stupid?  And most of us, I bet have even done something stupid and not felt the full consequences of it. So, even if that person did something to land themself in said predicament, I&rsquo;d like to think I could still find a way to lend a hand. I&rsquo;m careful in my language there as I would like to think that, but know it&rsquo;s not a guarantee I would. Anyhoo &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="buy-some-happiness-just-help">Buy Some Happiness, Just Help</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that simple, if you are in a position to help (<a href="https://twitter.com/ndm/status/1370154043100729349">or to earn more so you can help more</a>), then go ahead and do it. Not spending time/effort judging is rather liberating. Add helping to that and you&rsquo;ve got a pretty powerful anti-depressant as noted in the original tweet referenced above.</p>
<p>So, maybe you can use money to &lsquo;buy some happiness&rsquo; after all.</p>
