      <description>2020&amp;rsquo;s Trip in 2021 In January or February of last year, I signed up for a DIY frame bag making class. In so doing, I met a new friend (a few really, but one in particular), Matt. I saw that the location of the class was near my house &amp;hellip; at another house. Matt was involved with the bike collective I had started to go to and was looking into volunteering with.</description>

      <description>Money And Happiness First of all, Happy Pi day! Now on to the business (post) at hand &amp;hellip;
I came across this post a few days ago. and I quote retweeted it here. I&amp;rsquo;d like to just take a minute to expand on it some.
My Views Have Changed Over Time Just going to toss this out up front. In the past, I was much more of the &amp;ldquo;be independent, don&amp;rsquo;t rely on others &amp;hellip; you can sort things out independent of the hand you were dealt&amp;rdquo; type of person.</description>

      <description>Lot&amp;rsquo;s going on but not lots of posting. As I noted before I want to do helpful stuff on this blog. This post is selfish helpful. It&amp;rsquo;s helping me just think out loud.
Cycling w Friend/s == Sanity (for me at least) Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been a tough year for everyone in some different way. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly the social aspect. I recognize that I am extremely fortunate (spoiled?) in many ways.</description>

      <description>Como Fabricar Tu Propria Bolsa &amp;hellip; Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish!
I came across this video on making a stem bag and tried it out for myself (3 times now). The picture is of the 3rd one, where I feel like I got a pretty good handle on it, but still made some mistakes (as you&amp;rsquo;ll see I also did on my 4th one)
Why This Stem Bag, Why This Post?</description>

      <description>Since I said I&amp;rsquo;d talk about bikepacking some, let me tell you about a recent (not completely successful trip). Before I continue on my summary version, let me tell you a better full version is here.
We had already canceled one planned trip (to the San Rafael well) in late March. We were starting to feel better about local trips (given the pandemic curve etc.), So we headed off. The picture at the top was from the day before the ride when I was doing a test run with the bike loaded (but dry water bottles).</description>
